I still don't understand Question 1.2
Oh god, there's something terribly wrong with my spiking neuron equations.
For 5 c), do you still mean h(t)? I just don't see why plotting the frequency and the time domain of it will be that interesting.
In 5 c), A is going to be temporal sikes for each neuron? So I'm going to have to make an ensemble?
In 4, do you actually want the exact same signal as question 3d or you just want to generate another whitenoise signal? I'm assuming it's just another white noise signal, because I can't imagine why you'd want the same exact frequency again.
